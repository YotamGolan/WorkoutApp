The Version Control Policy sourcefiles are in this directory. running miktex with -output-directory=<DIR> 
was giving me issues so I am hand copy pasting the output pdf into the parent directory and changing its name
to "Version Control Policy". Please feel free to add on to the file as neccesary, keeping in line with the 
present styling and organization. DO NOT COMMIT THE COMPILE FILES (.aux etc). I really should add them to the
gitignore. That will maybe be for a later PR.
